# Meditation & Breathwork

## Garmin App User Guide

This guide is meant to support you — not overwhelm you.

You don’t need to understand everything to begin.  
Start with the **Beginner Guide**, and come back to the **Advanced Guide** whenever you’re curious.

# Beginner Guide

_(Everything you need to get started)_

## What This App Is About

Meditation & Breathwork helps you stay present while gently observing how your body responds during meditation and breathwork.

It allows you to:

- run simple or structured sessions
- receive vibration cues instead of visual distractions
- observe heart rate, HRV, stress, and breathing
- save sessions to Garmin Connect to notice patterns over time

The goal is **awareness, not performance**.

---

## Starting Your First Session

1. Open the app.
2. Select a session from the list.
3. Press **Start** (or tap the screen on touch devices).
4. Try to keep your wrist still for the first moments — this helps sensors settle.

During the session you’ll see:

- elapsed time
- current heart rate
- HRV status
- stress and respiration (if supported)
- small colored markers showing upcoming vibration alerts

You can:

- pause or resume with the **back button**
- stop the session with the **start/stop button**
- control screen brightness via your watch buttons or touch

When you stop, you can save or discard the session.  
Saved sessions appear in Garmin Connect after syncing.

## A Simple Way to Meditate (If You’re New to This)

If you don’t know how to meditate, you’re not alone - and you’re not behind.  
You’re already doing the most important thing: showing up.

Meditation is not about stopping thoughts, emptying the mind, or doing anything “right”. Even very experienced meditators notice their thoughts drifting every few seconds. That’s normal.

The practice is not staying focused.  
The practice is noticing when you’re not - and gently coming back.

If, for your first year of meditation, you did nothing more than what’s described below, that would already be enough. Truly.

And one more thing: the more **humor, gentleness, and loving-kindness** you can bring to your sessions, the more enjoyable the whole experience becomes - and often, the more helpful it is. You’re not trying to “win” meditation. You’re learning how to be with yourself.

---

### A Very Simple Practice

You don’t need to visualize anything or breathe in a special way.

1. Sit or lie down in a way that feels okay.
2. Let your breath happen naturally.
3. Bring your attention to the feeling of the breath at your nose.

You might notice:

- cool air as you inhale
- warmer air as you exhale
- subtle movement or tingling

That’s enough. Nothing else to achieve.

If it helps, you can quietly label it: _“in”_ … _“out”_.  
Soft and simple.

---

### When the Mind Wanders (It Will)

At some point - often after just a few seconds - your mind will wander.

You might start thinking about:

- what you should be doing
- something from the past
- something that annoys you
- absolutely nothing important at all

This does not mean you’re bad at meditation. It simply means your mind is doing what minds do.

Sometimes the mind even tries to pull you back into activity, tension, or a bit of chaos - because that’s what feels familiar and safe. It may offer you “very urgent” thoughts like:  
_“We should definitely reorganize our life right now.”_

You can meet that moment with a smile:

> “Ah, there you are again. You miss the chaos. Sneaky mind.”

---

### The Most Important Part

The moment you notice that your attention has drifted is not a failure. It’s the moment the practice is actually happening.

When you notice:

- pause for a second
- maybe even smile
- gently and kindly ask yourself:

  _“Do I want to come back to the breath right now?”_

If the answer is yes, return to the feeling of the breath at the nose.  
If the answer is no, that’s okay too - you can ask again later.

Every return is a small training moment.  
And every time you notice, you can quietly celebrate it: _“Oh - I noticed.”_ That’s awareness waking up.

---

### Be Kind With Yourself

Coming back again and again is not something to be annoyed about. It is the training.

Each time you notice and return:

- you strengthen awareness
- you build patience
- you teach your nervous system that calm is safe

So if you catch yourself being harsh, see if you can soften it just a little:  
_“Of course my mind wandered. That’s what minds do. Back we go.”_

Kindness works better than force. Curiosity works better than discipline.  
And humor makes the whole thing more human.

---

### If You Want to Go Deeper (Optional)

This simple practice can take you very far on its own.

If, at some point, you feel curious to learn more about meditation - especially about working with restlessness, fear, and kindness toward yourself - a wonderful place to start is:

**Pema Chödrön - _How to Meditate: A Practical Guide to Making Friends with Your Mind_** (Sounds True, 2013).

There is no rush. This is here whenever curiosity shows up.

---

### That’s Really It

There is nothing else you need to do.

If your mind wanders 100 times, and you come back 100 times - that was a good session.  
If you stayed with the breath for only a few seconds at a time - that was a good session.

Meditation is not about staying calm. It’s about learning how to return.

And you’re allowed to do that gently - with warmth, humor, and a little self-respect.

---

## Choosing a Session

From the session picker you can scroll through available sessions and see:

- session duration
- vibration pattern
- interval alert timing
- HRV indicator

### HRV Indicator (Quick Explanation)

- **Off** - HRV and stress tracking disabled
- **Waiting** - sensor has not settled yet (stay still for a moment)
- **Ready** - HRV tracking active  
  For reliable HRV data, minimize wrist movement.

---

## Breathwork Sessions (Simple Overview)

The app includes preconfigured breathwork sessions.  
A breathing cycle can include:

**Inhale → Hold → Exhale → Hold**

(Some techniques skip certain parts.)

### Included Patterns

**Box Breathing**  
Equal inhale, hold, exhale, hold (e.g. 4–4–4–4).  
Often used to calm the nervous system.

**Coherence Breathing**  
Inhale 5 seconds, exhale 5 seconds.  
Often associated with increased HRV.

**4-7-8 Breathing**  
Inhale 4, hold 7, exhale 8.  
Commonly used before sleep.

### Gentle Tips

- Inhale through the nose if possible
- Exhale through the mouth
- Longer exhales than inhales often help calm
- If timed breathing feels stressful, choose a simple session and breathe naturally

---

## Understanding Your Session Data (Beginner View)

### HRV (Heart Rate Variability)

HRV reflects how much the time between heartbeats varies.

- Higher HRV → calmer, more regulated states
- Lower HRV → activation or stress

Variability is **healthy** — it’s not something to fix.

### Stress

Lower stress values feel pleasant, but higher stress does **not** mean a bad session.

Sometimes a session is about staying present with discomfort.

### Heart Rate

Heart rate often slows as the body settles and usually aligns with HRV and stress.

### Respiration

Respiration data comes from Garmin sensors and is best used for trends, not precision.

# Advanced Guide

_(For customization, deeper insight, and power users)_

## Session Customization

From the session picker:

- Hold the **menu button** (or touch and hold the screen)
- Open **Add New** or **Edit**

You can configure:

### Session Basics

- Duration (H:MM)
- Color (used in visual indicators)
- Vibration pattern
- Activity type (Meditation / Yoga / Breathwork)
- HRV tracking level
- Custom session name (supports `[time]` placeholder)

### Interval Alerts

- One-off or repeating alerts
- Durations from seconds to hours
- Offset (delay before first trigger)
- Color per alert (or transparent to hide)
- Vibration or sound pattern

Only one alert runs at a time.  
Priority order: final alert → last one-off → last repeating alert.

---

## Custom Breathwork Patterns

Breathwork patterns are created using **parallel interval alerts** with offsets.

Example: **4–7–8 breathing**

- Total cycle: 19 seconds
- Inhale: Time=19, Offset=0
- Hold: Time=19, Offset=4
- Exhale: Time=19, Offset=11

Recommended vibration patterns:

- Inhale: ShortAscending
- Hold: ShortContinuous
- Exhale: ShortDescending

---

## Advanced HRV Metrics (Detailed Mode)

When HRV Tracking is set to **On Detailed**, the app records:

- RMSSD
- Successive heartbeat differences
- pNN20
- pNN50
- Raw heartbeat intervals
- HR derived from heartbeat intervals
- RMSSD rolling window
- SDRR (first 5 minutes)
- SDRR (last 5 minutes)

These values are for **exploration and learning**, not evaluation.

## FAQs & Troubleshooting

This section is here to help when something feels confusing or doesn’t work as expected.  
Most issues are easy to resolve, and nothing here means you’re doing anything wrong.

---

### HRV does not work or shows “waiting”

This usually means the sensor has not yet settled or something is interfering with it.

Try the following steps in order:

1. **Close and reopen the app**, then wait at least 30 seconds without moving your wrist.
2. Open **Global Settings** and select **Sensor restart**.  
   The app will shut down all heart-rate sensors and exit so the watch firmware can reinitialize them cleanly.  
   Reopen the app, stay still for about 30 seconds, then start your session.
3. If you are **not using an external heart-rate sensor** (like a chest strap), open your watch’s **connectivity settings** (not the app settings) and make sure all external sensors are disconnected.  
   Sometimes a nearby chest strap reconnects automatically and disrupts readings.
4. Check **sensor placement**. If you adjust the watch position, hold still for ~30 seconds to allow readings to stabilize.
5. Reinstall the app if the issue persists.
6. If you still don’t get reliable HRV, try:
   - wearing the watch on the **inside of your wrist**, or
   - using an external heart-rate sensor that supports heartbeat intervals (supported automatically, no app setting required).

---

### Can I change the name of a session on the watch?

Yes.

You can edit a session’s name directly on the watch:

- Open **Add New** or **Edit** for a session
- Select **Name**
- Enter text using the watch’s text picker

If you want the session name to also appear as the **activity name in Garmin Connect**, enable the setting described in **Global Settings → Session name = Activity name**.

You can use the placeholder `[time]` in session names.  
Example: `Deep rest [time]` → `Deep rest 20min`

---

### The app crashes as soon as I start a session

If the app opens but crashes immediately when starting a session, your watch model likely does **not support the selected activity type**.

Edit the session and choose a different activity type:

- Meditation
- Yoga
- Breathwork

If available on your device, a more generic activity type usually works on all models.

---

### The app does not track stress

Not all Garmin devices support **continuous stress tracking**.

Some older models (for example the Fenix 5X) only support **stress snapshots**, not real-time stress during activities. In these cases, stress data may be missing or limited.

This behavior depends on the watch hardware, not the app.

---

### But the old version of the app supported stress tracking?

The old version used a custom stress estimation algorithm.

The current version uses **Garmin’s built-in stress tracking** instead. This ensures consistency with Garmin Connect and avoids mismatches between different stress values, which caused confusion for many users.

---

### The respiration rate (breaths per minute) seems inaccurate

This is not specific to this app.

Respiration data comes directly from Garmin’s sensors. While it works well during active sports, it can be less reliable during very calm or still practices.

If accurate respiration data is important to you, using a **chest strap that supports respiration reporting** (for example HRM-Pro / HRM-600) may improve results.

---

### The screen is too bright when starting the app

This is controlled by your watch’s **Focus Mode** settings, not by the app.

By default, Garmin activates a focus mode for activities that sets screen brightness to around 80%.

To change this:

1. Open **Watch Settings**
2. Go to **Focus Modes**
3. Select **Activity**
4. Adjust **Brightness** under **Display & Brightness**

This will affect all activities started on your watch.

**Advanced option:**  
You can create a custom focus mode that triggers only for Meditation, Yoga, and Breathwork activities.

---

### How do I run an open-ended session?

You have two options:

- **Create a very long session** (for example 9 hours) and stop it manually when finished.
- **Disable auto-stop** in the global settings so sessions continue until you stop them.

---

### The app stopped working / I need support

Before reaching out, please try:

- restarting the app
- updating the app
- reinstalling the app
- rebooting your watch

If you still need help, please include:

- what you already tried
- when the issue started (after app update, watch firmware update, etc.)
- whether the issue exists in the previous version of the app

You can contact support using the **Contact Developer** link in the Garmin Connect IQ Store.

### I installed the app, but it doesn’t show up on my watch

That’s frustrating — especially when you just want to start a calm session and the tech gets in the way.

In this case, it’s important to know: **installation and delivery of Connect IQ apps to your watch is handled entirely by Garmin** (Garmin Connect / Connect IQ / Garmin Express and the sync process). The app itself cannot influence whether it appears on your device, and as the developer there’s nothing I can change in the code to fix an installation or sync issue.

What you can try quickly (optional):

- Sync your watch again in Garmin Connect
- Restart the watch and your phone, then sync again
- Uninstall the app, restart the watch, then reinstall the app and sync again

If it still doesn’t appear, the best next step is to contact Garmin Support, because this is a Garmin-side installation/sync issue:

- Garmin Support (Connect IQ install troubleshooting): https://support.garmin.com/en-US/?faq=67C7Y58Nxb6rkxt2Enbrf5
- Garmin Support (main support portal): https://support.garmin.com/
