At geigl.online, your privacy is important to me. This Privacy Policy explains how I collect, use, and protect your personal information when you use my [Meditation app](/meditate_app) on your Garmin device.

**1. Information I Collect**

When you use my Meditation app, I may collect certain information automatically, including:
* Your IP address (anonymized)
* Firmware version / MonkeC version
* Device type and operating system
* [Garmin's unique identifier](https://developer.garmin.com/connect-iq/api-docs/Toybox/System/DeviceSettings.html#uniqueIdentifier-var) that is unique per app and device
* Basic session metrics such as duration
* Usage patterns within the app
* If you are a developer, feel free to look at the relevant source code [here](https://github.com/floriangeigl/Meditate/tree/main/Meditate/source/com)

I use Google Analytics to help me understand how users interact with my app. Google may collect additional technical data as described in their [Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).

I use Cloudflare as a content delivery network (CDN) and security provider to ensure the fast and secure delivery of my website. When you access my website, your request is routed through Cloudflare's servers, which may temporarily log your IP address and other technical information for security and performance purposes. Cloudflare acts as a data processor on my behalf and does not use this data for any other purpose. For more information, please see [Cloudflare's Privacy Policy](https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/).

I use public content delivery networks (CDNs), such as jsDelivr or CDNJS, to load static resources like jQuery and Bootstrap. These CDNs may temporarily log technical information such as your IP address to serve content efficiently. This information is not used for tracking or analytics purposes.

**2. How I Use Your Information**

I collect and use this information to:
* Analyze and improve the performance and usability of my app
* Understand how users interact with the app
* Enhance your overall user experience

**3. Data Sharing**

I do not sell or share your personal information with third parties for marketing purposes. However, I may share aggregated, anonymized data with service providers such as Google for analytics purposes.

**4. Data Retention**

I retain analytics data for no longer than necessary. Google Analytics data retention is currently set to 14 months to understand usage trends over the course of a year.

**5. Your Rights**

Depending on your location, you may have the right to:
* Access the data I hold about you
* Request correction or deletion of your data
* Withdraw your consent to data processing
* Object to certain types of processing

To exercise your rights, please contact me at florian.geigl+privacy@gmail.com

I take appropriate measures to protect your data from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction.

**7. International Users**

If you are using my app from the European Economic Area (EEA), I process your data in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). IP anonymization is enabled in Google Analytics.
